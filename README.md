# Breast Cancer Prediction
### Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3
cancers diagnosed among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of
cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs because of abnormal growth of cells in
the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer
- tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant
(cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy are commonly used to
diagnose breast cancer performed.
